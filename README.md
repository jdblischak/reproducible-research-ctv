# Archived

The official source of the CRAN Task Views has migrated from R-Forge to GitHub.
Thus this repository that mirrored the copy in the official SVN repo is no longer required.
Please go to [cran-task-views/ReproducibleResearch](https://github.com/cran-task-views/ReproducibleResearch)
to open an Issue or submit a Pull Request.

This repository contains the `ctv` file for the [Reproducible Research CRAN Task View][ctv-rr].
The `ctv` file in this repository is manually synced with the officialy copy in the [CTV SVN repository][ctv-svn] on [R-Forge][].

[ctv-rr]: https://cran.r-project.org/view=ReproducibleResearch
[ctv-svn]: https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/ctv/

The Task View highlights CRAN packages that provide features for the following categories:

* literate programming
* pipeline toolkits
* package reproducibility
* project workflows
* code/data formatting tools
* format convertors
* object caching

Suggestions are welcome! If you know of a package that fits into one of these categories, but is missing from the Task View, please open an [Issue][new-issue] to discuss.
